# Decision Tree from Scratch (Python)

A complete implementation of a **Decision Tree classifier from scratch** using NumPy.
No ML libraries (like sklearn) are used for the model logic.

## Features
- Binary classification
- Entropy & Information Gain
- Recursive tree growth
- Max depth & minimum samples stopping criteria
- Tested on linear and non-linear datasets

## Datasets Used
- Breast Cancer dataset (sklearn)
- make_moons dataset (non-linearly separable)

## Results
- Breast Cancer dataset: ~90% accuracy
- make_moons dataset (noise=0.3): ~87% accuracy
